I want you to improve my research article @/EntCharML/Optica-template.tex by taking a look at my code @/entchar_old_mlebay.py and its results @/entanglement_results.csv . The plots for this are given in the @/plots/  folder using @/plot_old_mlebay.py  all this is for the training phase. Once the training is done, the saved nn models are loaded to be compared with mle and bayesian methods using @/predict_with_saved_models.py  whose results are stored in the @/prediction_outputs/benchmark_data/  and @/prediction_outputs/comparison_plots/ . Improve my research article by making detailed descriptions of the methods and a detailed analysis of the results and thereby providing a conclusion
